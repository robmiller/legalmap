# The Legal Map

The legal map is an effort to map the often confusing, contradictory and
convoluted world of international law, answering questions like "who's
a signatory of this treaty?" or "which countries still use the death
penalty?".

It can be viewed online at [legalmap.robm.me.uk][site].

The legal knowledge was assembled and painstakingly converted to JSON
format by Gillian McCall; the site was coded by Rob Miller.
